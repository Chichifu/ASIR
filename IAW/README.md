# About

This repository collects a simple PHP base utility code of general purpose in order to deploy the IAW exam.

# Design and Patterns

### The code implementation is very simple focused on the assignature requirements based on PHP.

* Control estructures
 - `for`
 - `if`
 - `elseif`
 - `switch`
 - `foreach`

### In order to make a robust, professional and really extensible app, the code implements a very simple object-oriented programming paradigm, including:

* `Encapsulation`
* `Abstraction`
* `Hierarchy` 

# Files architecture

* `classes`
  - `examen.php` Main abstract class
  - `template.php` Simple HTML template management class
* `template` 
  - `example.tpl` HTML template
`include`
  - `inc.php` PHP require files
